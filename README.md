### What I learned

In working on these components and this React project, I've learned the following:

This was my first React project and I've gained a strong understanding of React, including components, state management, and props.

- Conditional Rendering:

I've learned how to conditionally render UI elements based on user interactions or specific conditions.

I've learned how to interact with a backend API to perform operations like adding, editing, and deleting comments.

This project was my first experience with Firebase and Firestore. I gained a lot of experience in setting up a live database, performing data operations such as adding, editing, and deleting comments, and integrating real-time updates into my web application.
